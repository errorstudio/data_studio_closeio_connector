# Close.io data connector for Google Data Studio

This is a data connector to get leads and their contacts from Close.io, so you can cross-reference or report on them in Google Data Studio.

This is rather specific to a use-case we have at [Error](https://error.agency), namely getting all leads with a specific status, and all the contacts with a specific email type. But it would be easy to extend or parameterise.

# Use

Add the connector to your data studio report, and enter your Close.io API key. You will be able to choose the fields you want to add.
